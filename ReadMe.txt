Raffle program that stores raffles, users and items in a database so it can be reused.

Inspired by a coworker who wrote a raffle map using the StarCraft II editor.

This program is implemented in C# .Net using WPF with the MVVM pattern. Entity Framework is used for interacting with a SQL Server LocalDb database.
